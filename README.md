Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engenieering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software
its imporance are reliability, security, effficiency,scalability and flexibility of a software

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
mastering complexity
mastering process
mastering machine

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning - identfying the software recuirement and the problem it is solving.
requirement\ problem analysis - identfying final user specification.
design -bulding the framework of the software.
coding - implementation phase where the developer writes the actual code based on desighn specification
testing - conduct security and performance testing



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
           waterfall
       it is sequential and stuchured where each phase is completed before moving on
       it is low on flexibility thus changes are difficult to implement once completed.
       customer feedbak comes late, aafter the product is developed.
       testing is done at the end of the development process.     
        agile methodology
   it is iteractive and incremental, with multiple cycles.
   changes can be done at any phase of the development of the software.
   customer feedback can be incorporated at any stage of the software development.
   testing is continous and done after each iteration.
   
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

software developer - is a person who develop application, programs, and sysyem using programming languages and framework.
quality assuarance engineer - collaborates with the stakeholders to understand and clarify the software requirements.
 project manager -assembles and leads the software development team


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
an IDEs is a software plaltform that facilitates the creation of other software application by providing space to write, compile and debug code , eg visual studio code
VCS are software tools that helps software teems manage changes to sourse code over time

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
rapid technological advancement places considerable pressures on software developers to stay current
time constraints.
limited infrastruchure.
software security.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit tests - consists in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components or modules used by softwares.
intergration tests - verfy that diffrent modules or services used by application workwell together.
 system testing focuses on the entire software systemas whole.
 acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify that a softwares fulfills the customers requirement.
 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the process where you guide generative ai solution to generate desired outputs.
importance: improved user experience,increase flexibilty and developer control

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
example: tell me about technology.
improved prompt:explain the impact of ai in healthcare and busness industry in two paragraphs
